Understanding PHP for Report Generation


Primary Role in Project:
To enable the communication/flow of data from the databases and display it within the various screens of the web api

PHP Capabilities:
• PHP can generate dynamic page content and collect form data
• PHP can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on a server
• PHP can add, delete, or update data within databases
• PHP can be used to control user-access
• PHP is capable of encrypting data


Syntax:

Ex:
	<?php
	// PHP code goes here
	?> 

- All PHP must begin with <?php and end with ?>

PHP Follows Essentially HTML syntax
Ex:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<body>
	
	<?php
	$color = "red";
	 echo"My shoes are ". $color . "<br>";
	echo"My house is ". $COLOR . "<br>";
	?>
	
	</body>
	</html>

	
	
PHP Interaction with HTML:
	- Provides dynamic web page generation, providing mutable information (sourced via databases) that would otherwise remain static within an html web page
